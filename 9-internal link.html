            One sunny morning, Masha was running around with her bright red kite. She laughed as it soared higher and
            higher into the sky. But suddenly, a strong gust of wind carried the kite deep into the forest, tangling it
            in the tallest tree.

            Masha, determined as always, tried climbing the tree herself. But the branches were too high! She pouted,
            crossed her arms, and shouted, “Bear! Help me!”
